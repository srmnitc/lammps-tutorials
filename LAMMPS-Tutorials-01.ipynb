    "Aha!  Yes, it is relatively easy to start changing the directions in the x, y, and z directions.  For instance, if you change this line: <br>\n",
    "`lattice fcc 4 orient x 1 0 0 orient y 0 1 0 orient z 0 0 1`\n",

    "to this one: <br>\n",
    "`lattice fcc 4 orient x 1 1 0 orient y -1 1 0 orient z 0 0 1`\n",

    "then you get a simulation cell that is oriented in the $<110>$ directions in the x- and y- directions.  If you mess up on the math, i.e., try 110 and 110 for the x and y directions (without the '-1'), then LAMMPS will return: <br>\n",
    "`ERROR: Lattice orient vectors are not orthogonal`\n",

    "So, if you try the $<110>$-oriented single crystal cell, LAMMPS automatically scales the x- and y-direction periodic lengths to 5.6568542 Angstroms (i.e., $4\\sqrt{2}$).  After minimization, the cohesive energy per atom is `-3.35999998818379` ev, th\n",

    "First, check that the potential file is in the directory that you are running out of. Although, you can insert paths, if you want to store the potentials in another directory. Second, make sure that the potential file name is the same as that given in the input script. For instance, Windows has the habit of saving text files (like the potential files) with .txt extensions. If you happen to be running from a Windows operating system, I would change the settings so that you can see the extensions of the files as well. "
