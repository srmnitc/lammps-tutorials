    "In this tutorial, a molecular dynamics simulation in LAMMPS is used to show what happens to a polymer chain at a certain temperature after some time. The chain's movement is caused by a molecular forces between atoms in the chain and by temperature of the chain. These factors are modeled in LAMMPS to show the behavior of this polymer chain. The chain was previously prepared in MATLAB. It contains 100 atoms with bound between neighbor atoms. During the simulation, the chain was equilibrated and fluctuates at temperature. After that the chain was minimized to find it's minimal energy condition. The tutorial explains basic LAMMPS commands and shows how to make a movie using AtomEye and ImageJ. \n",

    "\n",
    "In general, this script does equilibration and minimization to the polymer chain. Polymer chain data file named `PE_cl100.txt` should be in the present working directory. The line `dump 1 all cfg 6 dump.PE_cl100_*.cfg mass type xs ys zs c_csym c_peratom fx fy fz` is used to output information during the simulation; this can be moved before the equilibration part of the script to output the process of equilibration. Please note that you need to change the time step for the dump command so it won't give too many or too few dump files. It may be reasonable to choose an `every n timesteps` number to correspond to roughly 100 snapshots. \n",
